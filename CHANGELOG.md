## [0.1.10] - 2026-05-18

First-class goal-drift primitive — declarative task-scoped capability
boundaries for agents. Closes the AGI-safety demo scenario (B): agent
given task X attempts a tool outside the declared scope → deny with
canonical drift payload.

### Added

- **`interceptor.task(name, allowed_tools=..., replace=False)`** —
  context manager (sync `with` and async `async with`) that bounds an
  agent's tool surface to an explicit allow-set. Tool calls outside
  `allowed_tools` trigger goal-drift handling: deny in enforce mode,
  log-and-allow in audit mode (matches existing audit semantics).
  Nesting defaults to intersecting with the enclosing scope
  (least-privilege); pass `replace=True` to swap instead.
- **`TaskScope`** dataclass — yielded by `interceptor.task()`. Extends
  `ScopeStats` with `task: str`, `allowed_tools: frozenset[str]`, and
  `drift_count: int`. Exported from `shieldops_sdk`.
- **`ShieldOpsDeniedError.task` + `.drift`** — populated when a deny
  was triggered by goal-drift inside a `task()` scope. `to_dict()`
  emits the two new fields only when meaningful, preserving the
  4-field shape for callers that construct the exception directly or
  hit a pattern/threshold deny.
- **`sdk/examples/langchain_goal_drift.py`** — runnable 3-tool demo
  (`fetch_url`, `read_doc`, `transfer_funds`) showing the AGI-safety
  scenario end-to-end against a LangChain agent.

### Changed

- `async_check()` short-circuits goal-drift through `check()` before
  any network round-trip. Drift is a client-side promise; the server
  doesn't know about task scopes, so spending a request on a
  known-off-scope tool call is wasted work.
- `check()` blocked-pattern branch now guards `_deny_count` increment
  with `action != "deny"` to prevent double-counting when both drift
  and a pattern apply to the same call. High-risk-pattern `risk_score`
  uses `max(risk_score, 0.7)` so a prior drift score of 1.0 is
  preserved.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-05-16

Release-pipeline fix. No SDK code behaviour changes — same public API
as 0.1.8.

### Changed

- **SLSA L3 provenance pipeline migrated** from
  `slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml@v2.1.0`
  to GitHub-native `actions/attest-build-provenance@v2`. Eliminates
  the cosmetic-red `SLSA L3 provenance / final` job that hard-failed
  on every prior release (0.1.0–0.1.8) even when provenance was
  successfully generated and attached (locked rule #666 — now retired).
  The new pipeline writes the SLSA v1 in-toto attestation to GitHub's
  central attestation API instead of attaching `.intoto.jsonl` to the
  GitHub Release.

### Fixed

- **`provenance` job re-added to `publish.needs`.** Now that the
  attestation flow is clean, publish can correctly require provenance
  generation as a precondition (proper SLSA semantics — no provenance,
  no publish).

### Internal

- Release workflow `provenance:` job no longer uses a reusable
  workflow caller; runs as a normal `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` job with
  `permissions: { id-token: write, contents: write, attestations:
  write }` and explicitly creates the draft GitHub Release for the
  triggering tag (previously implicit via `slsa-generator
  draft-release: true`).

### Verification (for consumers of 0.1.9+)

Prior releases attached `<artifact>.intoto.jsonl` to the GitHub
Release; verify the bundled attestation file. Starting at 0.1.9,
the attestation lives in GitHub's attestation API. Verify the wheel
or sdist with:

```bash
pip download --no-deps shieldops-sdk==0.1.9 -d /tmp/dl
gh attestation verify /tmp/dl/shieldops_sdk-0.1.9-*.whl --repo shieldops-io/shieldops-sdk
```

Functionally equivalent to the prior `.intoto.jsonl` verification.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-05-16

Three independent housekeeping items bundled to amortise the
operator-gate approval cost (the `pypi` env still has
`required_reviewers`, verified empirically post-0.1.7). No breaking
changes.

### Added

- **`py.typed`** marker shipping with the wheel (PEP 561). Downstream
  mypy / pyright / IDEs will start consuming the inline type hints
  that already cover every public class and method. Locked in
  `pyproject.toml` via an explicit `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
  artifacts = [...]` rule so a future `packages=` refactor can't
  silently drop it.
- **`ShieldOpsCallbackHandler(payload_in_error=True)`** opt-in keyword
  on the LangChain integration. When set, denied calls raise
  `RuntimeError` whose `args[0]` is the canonical
  `ShieldOpsDeniedError.to_dict()` JSON instead of the historic
  `PermissionError("ShieldOps blocked tool '<name>'")` string. The
  chained `ShieldOpsDeniedError` is preserved via `__cause__` in both
  modes. Default is `False`, preserving 0.1.0–0.1.6 behaviour.
- **`ShieldOpsInterceptor.add_arg_scanner(fn)`** public extension
  point. Register a custom scanner `Callable[[dict[str, Any]],
  tuple[float, list[str]]]` that runs alongside the built-in
  production/wildcard heuristics. Lets users plug PII detection,
  IAM-action detection, customer naming conventions, etc., without
  subclassing. Scanners stack: deltas accumulate (clamped to 1.0),
  reasons concatenate. Combines naturally with `deny_above` from 0.1.6
  for threshold-driven denies on custom signals.

### Changed

- `ShieldOpsInterceptor.check()` arg-heuristics path now drives a
  scanner chain (`self._arg_scanners`, seeded with the built-in
  `_arg_heuristics`) instead of inlining the production/wildcard
  scan. No observable behaviour change for callers that don't register
  custom scanners.

### Internal

- 5 new tests in `TestAddArgScanner` (delta+reason, no-op, stacking,
  cap-at-1.0, deny_above interaction); 3 new in `TestPayloadInError`
  (back-compat default, opt-in payload, chained cause); 2 new in
  `test_py_typed.py` (source-tree fence + importlib.resources fence).
  232 → 242 passing (+10 net).

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-16

Post-dogfood-loop release. The 5 reproducible warts from
`docs/sdk/dogfood_0_1_2.md` all shipped across 0.1.3–0.1.6; this
release does three independent housekeeping items bundled together to
amortise the operator-gate approval cost.

### Added

- **Stable `shieldops_sdk.integrations.autogen.ShieldOpsAutoGenWrapper`**
  and **`shieldops_sdk.integrations.openai_agents.ShieldOpsOpenAIAgentsHandler`**.
  Promoted out of `shieldops_sdk.experimental` after the surface stayed
  stable across three minor releases. Importing the stable modules
  emits zero warnings.
- **`sdk/examples/langchain_app.py`** — fourth-framework spike for
  dogfood wart #6 (FastAPI / Flask / CrewAI / LangChain all confirmed
  emitting the canonical denial payload). Shows how to extract the
  canonical `to_dict()` shape from `PermissionError.__cause__` inside
  a `ShieldOpsCallbackHandler` consumer.

### Changed

- **`ShieldOpsInterceptor._arg_heuristics(args)`** extracted as a
  private staticmethod. Pure refactor — same delta + reasons returned
  as the inline scan; existing 225 tests are the fence. No observable
  behaviour change.

### Deprecated

- `shieldops_sdk.experimental` package and the two submodules
  (`experimental.autogen`, `experimental.openai_agents`) now emit
  `DeprecationWarning` on import (was `UserWarning` in 0.1.0–0.1.6).
  Both still re-export the stable classes from
  `shieldops_sdk.integrations.*` so 0.1.6 user code keeps working
  through the transition. Scheduled for removal in 0.2.0.

### Internal

- `test_experimental.py` rewritten to assert `DeprecationWarning`
  (was `UserWarning`); added shim-coverage tests for both submodules
  + a class-identity fence proving `experimental.X is integrations.X`.
  New `test_promoted_integrations.py` (4 tests): stable imports emit
  zero warnings, wrappers function end-to-end. 225 → 232 passing.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-16

Closes the last open dogfood paper-cut (#2). All 5 reproducible warts
from `docs/sdk/dogfood_0_1_2.md` are now shipped; the friction journal
is effectively closed.

### Added

- **`ShieldOpsConfig.deny_above: float`** (default `1.01`, unreachable by
  design). Declarative risk-score threshold. When the cumulative
  `risk_score` (pattern lookup + arg heuristics) meets or exceeds this
  value AND `mode == ENFORCE`, the call is denied even when the
  `tool_name` did not match a built-in blocked pattern. Default `1.01`
  preserves pre-0.1.6 behaviour (risk_score clamps to `[0, 1]`, so the
  threshold branch never fires). Set to e.g. `0.7` to deny any call
  that hits the production-arg or wildcard-arg heuristics in enforce
  mode. The deny reason includes `"Risk score X.XXX meets deny
  threshold Y.YYY"` so audit consumers can distinguish pattern-driven
  from threshold-driven denials.

### Internal

- 6 new tests across `TestDenyAboveDefault` (config) +
  `TestDenyAboveThreshold` (interceptor): default, explicit value,
  threshold deny, audit-mode independence, pattern-deny regression,
  reason-string fence. 217 → 225 passing (8 cumulative with the +2
  from config defaults overlap).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-16

Ergonomics-only follow-on to `0.1.4`. No breaking changes. Closes the
last open dogfood paper-cut (wart #5) — promoted out of the
hold-on-external-signal bucket because pytest suites sharing a
module-level interceptor were hitting it on every refresh.

### Added

- **`ShieldOpsInterceptor.reset_stats()`** — zero the lifetime
  `total_calls` and `total_denials` counters without re-instantiating
  the interceptor or `importlib.reload`-ing its module. Touches
  counters only; policy, config, and mode are preserved. Active
  `with` / `async with` scopes are unaffected (ScopeStats snapshots
  baselines on entry). Closes dogfood wart #5 — the documented pattern
  is `interceptor.reset_stats()` in pytest `setup_method` / fixture
  teardown.

### Internal

- 5 new tests in `TestResetStats` (idempotent, mode-preserving,
  scope-aware, deny-count clearing); 212 → 217 passing.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-15

Cross-framework parity release. Closes dogfood wart #6 once the CrewAI
spike at `sdk/examples/crewai_app.py` confirmed the same denial-payload
pattern reproduces in a third framework (FastAPI + Flask + CrewAI). No
breaking changes; the legacy `ShieldOpsDeniedError(tool_name=..., reasons=...,
risk_score=...)` constructor still emits a 4-field `to_dict()` shape when
`request_id` is omitted.

### Added

- **`ShieldOpsDeniedError.to_dict()`** — canonical denial payload helper.
  Returns a JSON-serialisable dict with `tool_name`, `action="deny"`,
  `risk_score`, `reasons`, and (when set) `request_id`. Lets HTTP adapters
  emit the same 4-or-5-field shape across FastAPI, Flask, and CrewAI
  instead of each hand-rolling the conversion.
- **`ShieldOpsDeniedError.request_id`** field. The interceptor now plumbs
  the Decision's `request_id` through to the exception (both `check` and
  `async_check` paths) for end-to-end trace correlation. Direct
  `ShieldOpsDeniedError(...)` construction without `request_id` keeps the
  legacy behaviour — the field stays empty and is omitted from
  `to_dict()` output.
- **`sdk/examples/crewai_app.py`** — CrewAI `BaseTool` subclass that
  re-raises `ShieldOpsDeniedError` as a `RuntimeError(json.dumps(exc.to_dict()))`.
  Doubles as the cross-framework parity proof — was the third-framework
  signal needed to promote wart #6 from hold to fixed.

### Changed

- `sdk/examples/flask_app.py` and `sdk/examples/fastapi_app.py` now call
  `exc.to_dict()` instead of hand-rolling the denial body. The Flask demo
  also stops using `abort()` (which renders the dict as a stringified
  HTML body) in favour of `return jsonify(exc.to_dict()), 403`.

### Internal

- 11 new tests in `tests/test_exceptions.py` (`TestDeniedErrorToDict` +
  `TestDeniedErrorRequestId`); 201 → 212 passing total.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-14

Ergonomics-only follow-on to `0.1.2`. No breaking changes. Three paper-cuts
identified in `docs/sdk/dogfood_0_1_2.md` (FastAPI + Flask cross-framework
reproduction) are fixed:

### Added

- **`ScopeStats.duration_ms`** — computed property exposing the scope
  duration in milliseconds (`duration_s * 1000.0`). `duration_s` is
  retained for backwards compatibility. Telemetry exporters and
  human-readable JSON responses should prefer `duration_ms`, which avoids
  the scientific-notation rendering (`7.09e-05`) that `duration_s` produces
  for sub-millisecond scopes. (Dogfood wart #4.)
- **`ShieldOpsInterceptor.from_env()` one-shot startup banner** —
  `logger.info("shieldops.interceptor.from_env mode=… telemetry=… api_key=set|unset")`
  is emitted once per `from_env()` call so silent misconfigs are visible at
  app boot without forcing `strict=True`. Direct `ShieldOpsInterceptor(config)`
  construction stays silent. The `api_key` value is never logged. (Dogfood
  wart #3.)
- **`@interceptor.guard()` unguardable-tool_name `UserWarning`** —
  emitted at decoration time when the resolved `tool_name` is not in
  `effective_blocked_patterns | effective_high_risk_patterns` AND no
  `extra_*_patterns` are configured on the `ShieldOpsConfig`. Surfaces the
  silent-no-op footgun documented in dogfood entry #1 (default
  `tool_name = fn.__qualname__` is exact-match, almost never lines up with
  the bare-name patterns like `"drop_table"`). Suppressed when the user
  has signalled custom policy via `extra_*_patterns`. (Dogfood wart #1.)

### Internal

- New `TestScopeStatsDurationMs`, `TestGuardUnknownToolNameWarning`,
  `TestFromEnvBanner` test classes; 8 new tests (191 → 199 passing).
- Existing decorator-mechanics test classes now use
  `pytest.mark.filterwarnings("ignore:.*guard\\(\\) resolved tool_name.*:UserWarning")`
  at the class level so they don't trip the new warning while exercising
  decorator wiring.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-14

First user-visible feature release. Three small additions that make
integration cleaner. No breaking changes to the public API.

### Added

- **`ShieldOpsConfig.from_env(*, strict=False, **overrides)`** — explicit
  factory exposing the env-loading that already happens inside
  `model_post_init`. Kwargs override env values.
- **`ShieldOpsInterceptor.from_env(*, strict=False, **overrides)`** — thin
  one-liner wrapper. `interceptor = ShieldOpsInterceptor.from_env()`.
- **`SHIELDOPS_TELEMETRY`** env var (LOCAL | REMOTE | OTLP), mirroring
  the existing `SHIELDOPS_MODE` handling.
- **`strict=True`** raises `ShieldOpsConfigError` (new exception type) on:
  unparseable `SHIELDOPS_MODE`, unparseable `SHIELDOPS_TELEMETRY`,
  `telemetry=REMOTE` with no `api_key`, any unrecognized `SHIELDOPS_*` env
  var.
- **`@interceptor.guard(*, tool_name=None)`** decorator — wraps any sync
  or async function with firewall interception. Args are extracted via
  `inspect.signature.bind` so policy patterns that key on parameter names
  see the right value regardless of call style.
- **Per-scope stats on ctx mgr** — `with interceptor as scope: ...`
  yields a `ScopeStats { calls, denials, duration_s, mode }` populated
  on exit. Same shape for `async with`. The old no-op stub is gone.
- **`ScopeStats`** dataclass exported via `from shieldops_sdk import ScopeStats`.

### Fixed

- Latent `model_post_init` bug where `SHIELDOPS_MODE=audit` would
  override an explicit `ShieldOpsConfig(mode=ENFORCE)`. Now uses
  `__pydantic_fields_set__` so explicit kwargs always win.

### Internal

- 26 new tests across the from_env + ctx mgr + guard surfaces (165 → 191
  passing total). 2 sigstore-staging tests still CI-only.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-13

Pipeline-fix release. No SDK behaviour changes — same public API, same
default semantics. `0.1.0` proved publish + install + import end-to-end
against production PyPI; this release validates the verify-published
smoke-test fix on a fresh version.

### Fixed

- **release pipeline** — `verify-published` job's import smoke test now
  passes a `ShieldOpsConfig` to `ShieldOpsInterceptor`. The 0.1.0 release
  hit `TypeError: missing 1 required positional argument: 'config'`
  because the smoke-test one-liner instantiated `ShieldOpsInterceptor()`
  with no args. PyPI publish itself was unaffected (#668).
- **release pipeline** — `verify-published` install pin now strips the
  `-rcN` suffix from the resolved tag so RC rehearsals install the
  actual wheel version that PyPI accepted (#667).
- **release pipeline** — `publish` job decoupled from the buggy
  `slsa-github-generator` `final` reporter, which hard-fails with
  `SUCCESS=false` on v2.0.0 and v2.1.0 even when provenance + upload
  succeed (#666). Provenance still runs in parallel.

### Internal

- New `test_packaging.py` fences: pre-1.0 version invariant,
  CHANGELOG-coherence (mirrors release.yml prepare-job validation), and
  the verify-published smoke-test invariant codified as a unit test.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-10

First public release. Local-first by default — `ShieldOpsConfig()` with no
arguments makes zero network attempts and requires no credentials. Opt in to
remote telemetry explicitly via `telemetry=SDKTelemetry.REMOTE`.

### Added

- `shieldops_sdk.experimental` namespace for unstable framework integrations.
  Importing anything from it emits a one-time `UserWarning`. Currently houses
  `experimental.autogen` (Microsoft AutoGen) and `experimental.openai_agents`
  (OpenAI Agents SDK).
- `ShieldOpsConfig.extra_blocked_patterns` and
  `ShieldOpsConfig.extra_high_risk_patterns` — opt-in extension of the
  built-in policy catalogue without subclassing or monkey-patching. Merged
  with the SDK defaults at interceptor construction.
- `SDKTelemetry` enum (`LOCAL` | `REMOTE` | `OTLP`) and
  `ShieldOpsConfig.telemetry` field — telemetry destination is now an axis
  distinct from `mode` (block vs. audit).

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: default `telemetry` is `SDKTelemetry.LOCAL`. Previously,
  setting `api_key` alone caused `async_check()` to POST to the ShieldOps
  backend implicitly. Network calls now require BOTH `api_key` set AND
  `telemetry=SDKTelemetry.REMOTE`. Setting only `api_key` falls back to
  local evaluation — a deliberately safer default (no implicit network on
  credentials alone).
- `ShieldOpsTelemetry.flush()` routes by `(telemetry, api_key)`:
  - `REMOTE` + `api_key` set → POST batched spans to
    `{endpoint}/api/v1/firewall/spans`
  - `LOCAL` or empty `api_key` → clean no-op, drains batch counter only
  - `OTLP` → relies on `record_span()`-time OTLP push; `flush()` drains the
    batch counter
- Block decision in `interceptor.check()` is now strictly a function of
  `(mode, policy)` — independent of `telemetry` and `api_key`. Locked by a
  parametrized 12-cell matrix in `tests/test_telemetry_modes.py`.

### Internal

- Policy default catalogues moved from `interceptor.py` module-level sets
  into a private `shieldops_sdk._policy/` package. Defaults are now
  `frozenset` (immune to accidental global mutation). The
  `effective_blocked_patterns(config)` and
  `effective_high_risk_patterns(config)` helpers centralise the
  defaults-∪-extras merge so future callbacks/feature additions reuse one
  implementation instead of duplicating merge logic.

### Removed

- Module-level `_DEFAULT_BLOCKED_PATTERNS` and `_HIGH_RISK_PATTERNS` symbols
  from `shieldops_sdk.interceptor` (they were underscore-private, never
  part of the public API). Import from `shieldops_sdk._policy._defaults`
  instead if your code reached into the old names.

## [0.9.0-pre] - 2026-04-17

Pre-release carve-out of `sdk/` from ShieldOps monorepo. Apache-2.0 license.
